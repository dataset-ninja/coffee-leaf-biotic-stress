**Deep Learning for Classification and Severity Estimation of Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress** is a dataset for semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry, and in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 500 images with 2977 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *leaf* and *symptom*.

Images in the Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *Train* (400 images), *Val* (50 images), and *Test* (50 images). The dataset was released in 2019.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
