**Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress** (Deep Learning for Classification and Severity Estimation of Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress) is a dataset for semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 500 images with 2977 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *leaf and symptom*.

Each image in the Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 0 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *Test* (50 images), *Val* (50 images), and *Train* (400 images). The dataset was released in 2018.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 2 classes:
