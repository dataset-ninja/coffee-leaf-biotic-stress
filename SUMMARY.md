**Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress** (Deep Learning for Classification and Severity Estimation of Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress) is a dataset for semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 500 images with 2977 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including _leaf_ and _symptom_.

Each image in the Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 0 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: _Test_ (50 images), _Val_ (50 images), and _Train_ (400 images). The dataset was released in 2019.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 2 classes:
