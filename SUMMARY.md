**Deep Learning for Classification and Severity Estimation of Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry, and in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 500 images with 2977 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *leaf* and *symptom*. There are 3 splits in the dataset: *Train* (400 images), *Test* (50 images), and *Val* (50 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
