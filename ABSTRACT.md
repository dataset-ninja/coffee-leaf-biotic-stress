Biotic stress consists of damage to plants through other living organisms. The efficient control of biotic agents such as pests and pathogens (viruses, fungi, bacteria, etc.) is closely related to the concept of agricultural sustainability. Agricultural sustainability promotes the development of new technologies that allow the reduction of environmental impacts, greater accessibility to farmers and, consequently, increased productivity. The use of computer vision with deep learning methods allows the early and correct identification of the stress-causing agent. So, corrective measures can be applied as soon as possible to mitigate the problem. The objective of this work is to design an effective and practical system capable of identifying and estimating the stress severity caused by biotic agents on coffee leaves.
