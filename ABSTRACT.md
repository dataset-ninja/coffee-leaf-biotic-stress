The **Coffee Leaf Biotic Stress** dataset asserts that biotic stress involves plant damage inflicted by living organisms. Effectively managing biotic agents, such as pests and pathogens (viruses, fungi, bacteria, etc.), is intricately linked to the concept of agricultural sustainability. Agricultural sustainability advocates for the development of new technologies to minimize environmental impacts, enhance accessibility for farmers, and consequently, boost productivity. Leveraging computer vision with deep learning methods enables the timely and accurate identification of stress-inducing agents. Thus, corrective measures can be promptly implemented to mitigate the issue. The goal of this initiative is to devise an efficient and practical system capable of identifying and assessing the severity of stress caused by biotic agents on coffee leaves.
